## Description

<img src="https://matomo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/logo-woocommerce.png" style="width:260px;float:right;margin-bottom: 10px;" alt="WooCommerce Analytics">Turbocharge the integration between your WooCommerce store and your Matomo. Get detailed insights in your shop's eCommerce activites to drive more revenue and to improve your sales funnel:

* Find out which channels you should be spending more time and money on
* Discover where you are losing potential money
* Maximize your shop's profitability
* Learn which products your customers are actually interested in and what they are looking for
* Make data-driven decisions that make you more successful with ease
* Get the insights you want faster and easily keep on top of your business performance

Our official Matomo WooCommerce integration will track all your WooCommerce orders and cart updates. Using WooCommerce ourselves, we have worked on a solution that tracks Ecommerce purchases and cart updates very accurately:

* Tracks even when ad-blockers are enabled. 
* Compatible with most WooCommerce plugins (eg up-selling plugins).
* Makes sure to only track cart updates when there are actually changes to the cart so you get more insights into abandoned carts and can actually identify why users did not complete the order. 
* Tracks only orders that actually complete and ignores for example failed orders (if the status changes later, the plugin will recognize this and correctly track it)
* Fully compatible with [WP-Piwik/WP-Matomo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-piwik/) (recommended) or use WooCommerce Analytics on its own to get your Ecommerce Analytics

Compared to other Piwik/Matomo-WooCommerce integrations, this plugin works 100%.
